# Note Mover
Automatically moves notes in Obsidian based on their tags and properties (frontmatter). The plugin uses powerful Dataview queries to determine which files match your specified rules. You can configure:

- Note source: Where to search for notes.
- Target folders: Where to move matching files.
- Exclusions: Which folders to ignore.
- Rules: Dataview queries that define moving conditions. Includes guidance for creating queries based on tags, properties, and their values.

Dependencies: Requires the Dataview plugin.
